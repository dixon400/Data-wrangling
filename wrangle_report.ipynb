    "<h1> WRANGLE REPORT </h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2> Introduction </h2>\n",
    "    This project implements the data wrangling process for the tweet archive \"WeRateDogs\" which is a twitter account that rates dogs with a funny comment about the dog. I followed the 'Gather-Access-Clean' method of the data wrangling process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<h3> Gather Data </h3>\n",
    "<b> The Twitter Archive </b>: This data was provided by udacity and was downloaded manually as a csv file and read with pandas read_csv method. It consists of about 2000+ rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Image Prediction </b>: This is a tsv file that was provided by udacity as a url link and it was downloaded programatically. The python request library was used to complete this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Twitter Data </b>: Ideally, this should be downloaded programatically from twitter using tweepy and the twitter api. Unfortunately, I do not have the credentials to call twitter api, hence Udacity provided this.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Access Data </h3>\n",
    "    <blockquote>All files were read with the pandas read_csv method and each was passed into a variable as dataframe.\n",
    "Each of the data frames were evaluated visually and programmatically. The following quality and tidiness issues were\n",
    "observed during the assessment.</blockquote>\n",
    "<h3> Quality Issues </h3>\n",
    "<b> The Twitter Archive </b>:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The source value is in HTML format. It should be in strings</li>\n",
    "    <li>\"None\" is not a dog name, remove values with \"none\".</li>\n",
    "    <li>Missing URLs in expanded_urls</li>\n",
    "    <li>Drop rows with NA in the retweeted_status_id </li>\n",
    "    <li> Change source type to Category  </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Image Prediction </b>:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Remove duplicate jpg_url entries</li>\n",
    "    <li>Missing images</li>\n",
    "    <li> Drop image number column </li>\n",
    "    <li>Erroneous datatype (tweet_id)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "    <li>Remove duplicate jpg_url entries</li>\n",
    "    <li>Erroneous datatype (tweet_id)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h3> Tidiness Issues </h3>\n",
    "    - The columns on the df_prediction table should be on the archive table.<br>\n",
    "    - The tweet_json should be merged with the archive table.\n",
    "    - The dog stages should be a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3> Clean Data </h3>\n",
    "    I used the define-code-test approach to handle the quality and tidiness issues found in the data set."
